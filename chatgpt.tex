\begin{abstract}
We present an improved sketch of a proof of the Kakeya conjecture, which asserts that any Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (i.e. a set that contains a unit line segment in every direction) must have full Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension $n$. Our approach decomposes the set using spherical coordinates and employs a dimension–preserving mapping. We indicate the main steps and highlight the technical gaps that must be filled to complete the proof.

\section{Introduction}
A \emph{Besicovitch set} in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a set that contains a unit line segment in every direction. The \emph{Kakeya conjecture} asserts that any such set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ has full Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension, i.e.,
\[
\dim_H K = \dim_M K = n.
\]
This conjecture plays an important role in harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. In what follows we outline a strategy based on spherical coordinates and dimension–preserving maps, and we point out where further work is needed to rigorously justify the steps.

\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Spherical Coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^n$}
Every point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be written in spherical coordinates as 
\[
x=(r,\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_{n-1}),
\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r\ge0$ is the radial coordinate,
    \item $(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1})$ are the angular coordinates, with $\theta'=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1})\in S^{n-1}$.
\end{itemize}
Standard formulas give the conversion between Cartesian and spherical coordinates and yield the familiar volume element
\[
dV = r^{n-1}\prod_{i=1}^{n-2}\sin^{n-i-1}\theta_i \, dr \, d\theta_1 \cdots d\theta_{n-1}.
\]

\subsection{Besicovitch Sets and Dimension}
\begin{definition}
A \emph{Besicovitch set} in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ that contains a unit line segment in every direction.
\end{definition}

Our goal is to show that 
\[
\dim_H K = \dim_M K = n.
\]
A common strategy is to decompose $K$ into a family of line segments and analyze the mapping that takes the directional parameters to points in $K$.

\section{Outline of the Proof}
Let $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a Besicovitch set. For each direction $\theta' \in S^{n-1}$ we choose a unit line segment contained in $K$. By a suitable translation we may assume that for each $\theta'$ there exists a vector $s(\theta')\in\mathbb{R}^n$ so that the corresponding segment is
\[
u_{\theta'} = \{\, s(\theta') + r\,\theta' : r\in[0,1] \,\} \subset K.
\]
Then we have the representation
\[
K \supset \bigcup_{\theta'\in S^{n-1}} u_{\theta'}.
\]

\subsection{The Dimension–Preserving Mapping}
Define the map
\[
F: S^{n-1}\times [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n,\qquad F(\theta',r)= s(\theta')+r\,\theta'.
\]
The key idea is that if $F$ does not decrease dimension, then
\[
\dim_H K \ge \dim_H\bigl(F(S^{n-1}\times[0,1])\bigr) \ge \dim_H (S^{n-1}\times[0,1]).
\]
Since 
\[
\dim_H (S^{n-1}\times[0,1]) = (n-1) + 1 = n,
\]
it follows that $\dim_H K \ge n$. But $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, so we conclude $\dim_H K = n$. A similar argument applies for Minkowski dimension.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:dim_preserve}
If $F:X\to Y$ is a Lipschitz (or more generally, dimension–preserving) map between metric spaces, then
\[
\dim_H F(X) \ge \dim_H X.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
This is a classical fact in geometric measure theory; see, e.g., the discussion in \cite{Wolff1995}. The idea is that Lipschitz maps do not increase the size of coverings by more than a constant factor, so the Hausdorff measure in the appropriate dimension remains nonzero.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Filling the Gaps}
A significant gap in the above outline is the assumption that one can choose the translations $s(\theta')$ so that the map $F$ is (locally) Lipschitz or, at least, does not decrease dimension. In many constructions of Besicovitch sets the placement of the segments is highly nonuniform and the map $\theta'\mapsto s(\theta')$ may be very irregular.

One must show that there exists a choice of $s(\theta')$ for which $F$ is \emph{dimension–preserving} in the sense of Lemma~\ref{lem:dim_preserve}. This typically involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyzing the overlaps among different segments in $K$,
    \item Using transversality or a discretized version of the mapping to control the irregularities.
\end{itemize}
A full proof would require a detailed construction and estimates showing that the ``bad'' set where $F$ fails to be Lipschitz (or where the Jacobian degenerates) is negligible from the point of view of Hausdorff dimension. See, e.g., \cite{Wolff1995,Tao2000} for techniques in this direction.

\section{Conclusion}
Under the assumption that one may choose the translations $s(\theta')$ so that the map 
\[
F(\theta',r)= s(\theta')+r\,\theta'
\]
is dimension–preserving, the above argument shows that 
\[
\dim_H\bigl(F(S^{n-1}\times[0,1])\bigr)=n,
\]
and therefore any Besicovitch set $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ must satisfy
\[
\dim_H K = \dim_M K = n.
\]
While the construction of such an $s(\theta')$ remains the central technical challenge, the approach outlined here offers a promising avenue toward a proof of the Kakeya conjecture.

\section{Intro}

It can be seen from the drawing~\ref{fig:example}, that Kakeya conjecture is false for~$n=2$. Below I will present a rigorous proof of this.

Therefore the classic proof~\cite{kakeya2d} is wrong. Many articles need to be retracted.

\section{The problem}

I will point a counterexample against Kakeya's conjecture for~$n=2$.

\textbf{Kakeya's conjecture for $n=2$.} A union of unit-length intervals on a plane has Hausdorff dimension~$2$, if there are intervals of all possible directions among them.

The counterexample:

Let $x = \sum_{i\in\mathbb{N}} \frac{x_i}{2^i} \mapsto \sum_{i\in\mathbb{N}} \frac{2\cdot x_i}{3^i} = c(x)$ be the usual mapping from reals to the Cantor set.
The counterexample is the union~$U=\bigcup_{x\in[0;1[}V_x$ of intervals \[ V_x = \setcond{(c(x)-t\cos(\pi x), t\sin(\pi x))}{t\in\left]0;1\right[}. \]

\section{The proof}

First, it is easy to see that segments~$V_x$ don't intersect each other.

Let vertical intervals \[ V'_x = \setcond{(c(x), t)}{t\in\left]0;1\right[}. \]

Using~\cite{189275} we easily deduce that $W=\bigcup_{x\in[0;1[}V'_x$ has dimension~$1+\alpha$ where $\alpha=\frac{\ln 2}{\ln 3}$ is the dimensionality of the Cantor set. We will prove, that $U$~and~$W$ are diffeomorphic to finish the proof. The diffeomorphism is given by the mapping \[ (c,t) \mapsto (c-t\cos(\pi x), t\sin(\pi x)). \]

It is an obvious bijection. That it is~$C^1$-smooth in is also obvious.

\section{``Political'' context}

I discovered ordered semigroup/semicategory actions in 2019. The world didn't react obeying like a sheep to decision of Russian Orthodoxes to kick people like me from normal life such as academic carrier. That's scary: the most valuable component is a missing component. Missing ordered semigroup actions amount to like half of world economy missing~\cite{osa-important}.

I don't know how Kakeya conjecture is used in the rest of math, but I use it to build a bridge between two about halves: academic math and the second lost half, through my glorification.

The advice: ``Solve some famous open problem to prove that you are a good mathematician.'' sounded for me like a mocking. But in the new reality, I indeed did it.

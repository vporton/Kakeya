\maketitle  

\emph{This is a preliminary draft sketch of my proposed proof of Kakeya conjecture. Report any errors, please.}

The proof uses theory of funcoids~\cite{volume-1}. It looks like that funcoids can be easily excluded from the proof, making the proof elementary. In this case, the role of funcoids is to provide intuition that helped to find the proof.

\textbf{Kakeya set conjecture:} Define a \emph{Besicovitch} set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to be a set which contains a unit line segment in every direction. Is it true that such sets necessarily have Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension equal to~$n$?

\section{Kakeya proof (rough draft)}

\subsection{$n$-fun\-co\-ids}

By an $n$-fun\-co\-id (for a natural~$n$) we will understand a filter on the set~$\Gamma_n$ of finite unions of Cartesian products of $n$~sets. I will denote join and meet of funcoids in the order \emph{reverse} to set-the\-o\-re\-tic inclusion respectively as $\bigsqcup$ and $\bigsqcap$.

By $\mathord{\uparrow}F$ I denote the $n$-fun\-co\-id corresponding to $n$-ary relation~$F$ by the formula
\[ \mathord{\uparrow}F = \setcond{X\in\Gamma_F}{X\supseteq F}. \]

\begin{exer}
$\bigcap\mathord{\uparrow}F = F$.
\end{exer}

Thus, we have an injection from the set of $n$-ary relations (on some sets) to the set of $n$-fun\-co\-ids.
This allows to idenitify $F$ with $\uparrow F$.

For $n\leq m$ I will denote applying $m$-fun\-co\-id~$f$ to $n$-fun\-co\-id~$x$ as
\[ \bigsqcap\setcond{\mathord{\uparrow} F[X]}{F\in f,X\in x}, \]
where $F[X]$ is considered as a relation of $2$~arguments: $F\subseteq F_Y\times F_X$.

\subsection{Spherical coordinates}

I will denote $n$-dimensional spherical coordinates as~$\theta=(r, \theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1})$.
I also denote direction $\theta'=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1})$.

Here $r\geq 0$; $\theta_i\in[0;\pi]$ for $i=1,\dots,n-2$; $\theta_{n-1}\in[0;2\pi\mathclose[$ .

Mapping $\Sigma_n$ from spherical coordinates to Euclidean coordinates is defined by the formulas:
\[
\begin{aligned}x_{1}&=r\cos(\theta _{1}),\\x_{2}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\cos(\theta _{2}),\\x_{3}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\sin(\theta _{2})\cos(\theta _{3}),\\&\qquad \vdots \\x_{n-1}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\cdots \sin(\theta _{n-2})\cos(\theta _{n-1}),\\x_{n}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\cdots \sin(\theta _{n-2})\sin(\theta _{n-1}).\end{aligned}
\]

Accordingly~\cite{polar-jacobian} the determinant of Jacobian of this transformation is
\[ \det (J\Sigma_n)(\theta) = r\sin\theta_1\dots\sin\theta_{n-2}\det (J\Sigma_{n-1})(\theta). \]
Therefore
\[
\det (J\Sigma_n)(\theta)\ne 0\Leftrightarrow 0\notin\{r,\sin\theta_1,\dots,\sin\theta_{n-2}\}.
\]
So, $\det (J\Sigma_n)(\theta)\ne 0$ almost everywhere.

Mapping $\Pi_n$ from Euclidean coordinates to spherical coordinates is defined by the formulas:
\[
\begin{aligned}r&={\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}+\cdots +{x_{2}}^{2}+{x_{1}}^{2}}}},\\\theta _{1}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left({\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}+\cdots +{x_{2}}^{2}}}},x_{1}\right),\\\theta _{2}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left({\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}+\cdots +{x_{3}}^{2}}}},x_{2}\right),\\&\qquad \vdots \\\theta _{n-2}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left({\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}}}},x_{n-2}\right),\\\theta _{n-1}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left(x_{n},x_{n-1}\right).\end{aligned}
\]  

At points $0\notin\{r,\sin\theta_1,\dots,\sin\theta_{n-2}\}$ that is $0\notin\{x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ the Jacobian $(J\Pi_n)(x)$
is full rank as a reverse of a full rank Jacobian.

So, $\det (J\Pi_n)(x)\ne 0$ almost everywhere.

\subsection{Stereographic projection diffeomorphism}

Consider~$\Gamma_n$, the ``standard'' stereographic projection from $S^n$ without the North pole $\zeta=(0,\dots,0,1)$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$:

\begin{align*}
&\Gamma_n(q_1,\dots,q_{n+1}) = \left(\frac{q_1}{1-q_{n+1}},\dots,\frac{q_{n-1}}{1-q_{n+1}}\right);\\
&\Gamma_n^{-1}(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \left(\frac{2x_1}{\lVert x\rVert^2+1},\dots,\frac{2x_{n+1}}{\lVert x\rVert^2+1},\frac{\lVert x\rVert^2-1}{\lVert x\rVert^2+1}\right),
\end{align*}
where $\lVert x\rVert^2 = x_1^2+\dots+x_n^2$.

It is known~\cite{stereo} to be a diffeomorphism.

\subsection{The proof}

Let $K$ be a Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

I will call the \emph{right vicinity} or \emph{one-si\-de vicinity} of a point~$a$ the funcoid~$\supfun{\Delta_{>}}\{a\}$.

We will do our geometry in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Dimensionality of a funcoid is defined as least dimensionality of a set above it.

Instead of proving the Kakeya conjecture, we will prove a stronger statement:

\begin{claim}
(Funcoidal) join~$L$ of one-si\-de vicinities of each point on $S^n\setminus\{\zeta\}$ has dimension~$n$, provided that the set~$K_1$ of directions (measured as their ``projection'' to unit sphere) is $n$-di\-men\-sio\-nal.
\end{claim}

The above claim is equivalent to (because adding one point does not change dimension):

\begin{claim}
(Funcoidal) join~$L$ of one-si\-de vicinities of each point on $S^n$ has dimension~$n$, provided that the set~$K_1$ of directions (measured as their ``projection'' to unit sphere) is $n$-di\-men\-sio\-nal.
\end{claim}

\begin{del}
Consider a diffeomorphism of an open set of the sphere to open disk with center of the point~$a$ of touching in each its tangential hyperplane.

Consider vicinities from the sphere replaced by vicinities from the disk (we may [TODO] further distort the disk in order to make them straight).

Join of all vicinities in the disk, is some $(n+1)$-fun\-co\-id under the disk. Infinitely shrinking the disk, we get its corresponding funcoidal meet~$h_a$.
\end{del}

Replace each ``curved'' vicinity from point~$a$ of the hypersphere by a straight one~$h_a$ (going outside the hypersphere in~$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$). Let $s_a$ be an ``outward'' radial vicinity of point~$a$. Then take funcoidal join $H=\bigsqcup_{a\in K_1}(h_a\sqcup s_a)$ of all these straight vicinities. Informally, $H$ is a ``swelling'' on the hypersphere in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

The straight vicinities $h_a$, projected to the sphere by the radial projection, become original curved vicinities,
because stereographic projection maps lines [FIXME]. [FIXME: So, lines are not great circles, and it is yet to prove that $L$ is of the same dimensionality as~$\supfun{b}H$. It can be solved by considering a small part of the sphere and a small part of the Euclidean space corresponding by a diffeomorphism.]

If $H$ projected to the sphere (by straight lines toward its center) has dimension~$n$, then the claim is proved, because it is diffeomorphic to~$L$.

\begin{lem}
If a set $H$ has dimension~$n+1$, then its projection~$K_1$ to~$S^n$ has dimension~$n$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Follows from~\cite{189275}\footnote{Or \href{https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_2e0aef8b-4309-420f-815c-a09d76ae97c1}{these AI musings}
that I didn't check for correctness}.
(We also apply that spherical coordinates are diffeomorphic to Euclidean coordinates, except of a negligible set.)
\end{proof}

It follows, that if we prove that $H$ has dimension~$n+1$, then [TODO: Need to specify a diffeomorphism.] $K_1$~has dimension~$n$ and our claim is proved.

Let map (name the map $b$\footnote{From \textbf{b}lack hole.}) the sphere together with its swelling to coordinates center by the formula $r\mapsto r-1$ for $r\geq 1$ (leaving $\theta'$ the same).
This preserves the dimension because the Jacobian matrix has full rank almost everywhere (hint: The Jacobian is the identity matrix).
Obviously, it is a diffeomorphism of $\setcond{x}{r>1}$ to $\setcond{x}{r\ne 0}$. So we preserve the dimension of the $(n+1)$-fun\-co\-id~$H$.

Thus we have enough to prove that join of one-si\-de vicinities of the same point (the center of our sphere without the North pole) is~$n$.

\begin{obvious}
$\supfun{b}s_a$ is a vicinity from the center to the direction~$a$.
\end{obvious}

By properties of diffeomorphisms, the shrinked by $r\mapsto r-1$ swelling~$H$ has the same dimensionality as~$H$.

By properties of $n$-fun\-co\-ids, it's evident [TODO: Prove.] that after being shrinked, it has dimensionality~$n+1$.

\begin{del}
To prove this use di\-men\-si\-on-pre\-ser\-ving map from spherical coordinates to Euclidean coordinates.

We've got the funcoidal product (e.g.\ subatomic product) of $n$\ vicinities what is obviously of dimension~$n$.

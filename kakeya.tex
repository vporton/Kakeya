\begin{abstract}
A rather short proof of Kakeya conjecture in arbitrary Euclidean spaces is presented. The proof uses several space transformations/projections. The conjecture is reduced to a Ka\-ke\-ya-li\-ke theorem on a hypersphere.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle  

In this article, I prove Kakeya conjecture in an arbitrary Euclidean space.

\textbf{Kakeya set conjecture:} \cite{kakeya-long,tao-blog-kakeya} Define a \emph{Besicovitch} set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to be a set which contains a unit line segment in every direction. Is it true that such sets necessarily have Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension equal to~$n$?

We will prove only for Hausdorff dimension, because Minkowski dimension cannot be lower and having a proof for Hausdorff dimension also proves it for Minkowski one. $\dim$ operator will mean Hausdorff dimension.

\section{Kakeya proof}

\subsection{Spherical coordinates}

I will denote $n$-dimensional spherical coordinates as~$\theta=(r, \theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1})$.
I also denote direction $\theta'=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1})$.

Here $r\geq 0$; $\theta_i\in[0;\pi]$ for $i=1,\dots,n-2$; $\theta_{n-1}\in[0;2\pi\mathclose[$ .

Mapping $\Sigma_n$ from spherical coordinates to Euclidean coordinates is defined by the formulas:
\[
\begin{aligned}x_{1}&=r\cos(\theta _{1}),\\x_{2}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\cos(\theta _{2}),\\x_{3}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\sin(\theta _{2})\cos(\theta _{3}),\\&\qquad \vdots \\x_{n-1}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\cdots \sin(\theta _{n-2})\cos(\theta _{n-1}),\\x_{n}&=r\sin(\theta _{1})\cdots \sin(\theta _{n-2})\sin(\theta _{n-1}).\end{aligned}
\]

Accordingly~\cite{polar-jacobian} the determinant of Jacobian of this transformation is
\[ \det (J\Sigma_n)(\theta) = r\sin\theta_1\dots\sin\theta_{n-2}\det (J\Sigma_{n-1})(\theta). \]
Therefore
\[
\det (J\Sigma_n)(\theta)\ne 0\Leftrightarrow 0\notin\{r,\sin\theta_1,\dots,\sin\theta_{n-2}\}.
\]
So, $\det (J\Sigma_n)(\theta)\ne 0$ almost everywhere.

Mapping $\Pi_n$ from Euclidean coordinates to spherical coordinates is defined by the formulas:
\[
\begin{aligned}r&={\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}+\cdots +{x_{2}}^{2}+{x_{1}}^{2}}}},\\\theta _{1}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left({\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}+\cdots +{x_{2}}^{2}}}},x_{1}\right),\\\theta _{2}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left({\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}+\cdots +{x_{3}}^{2}}}},x_{2}\right),\\&\qquad \vdots \\\theta _{n-2}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left({\textstyle {\sqrt {{x_{n}}^{2}+{x_{n-1}}^{2}}}},x_{n-2}\right),\\\theta _{n-1}&=\operatorname {atan2} \left(x_{n},x_{n-1}\right).\end{aligned}
\]  

At points $0\notin\{r,\sin\theta_1,\dots,\sin\theta_{n-2}\}$ that is $0\notin\{x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ the Jacobian $(J\Pi_n)(x)$
is full rank as a reverse of a full rank Jacobian.

So, $\det (J\Pi_n)(x)\ne 0$ almost everywhere.

\subsection{Gnomonic projection}

Gnomonic projection (figure~\ref{fig:gnomonic}) is a projection with the center of the hypersphere being the center of the projection and the projection hyperplane not passing through the center of the sphere.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gnomonic}
    \caption{Gnomonic projection}
    \label{fig:gnomonic}
\end{figure}

The formulas for projection of a point $p=(p_1,\dots,p_{n+1})$ ($\norm{p} = 1$) of the hypersphere are:

$q=\frac{p}{s\cdot p}$, where $q$ is the projection, $s$ is the North point of the sphere. Note that $q_{n+1}=1$. We will exclude this coordinate.

It is evident that gnomonic projection is a diffeomorphism between the hyperplane and ``open-half-hy\-per\-sphe\-re'' ($s\cdot p>0$). Let denote it~$S^n_{>}$.

I will denote the Gnomonic projection as~$\Phi_n$.

It is well known that Gnomonic projection maps great circles to lines (figure~\ref{fig:circles} shows a direction line mapping to a great circle).

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{circles}
    \caption{A great circle corresponding to line direction}
    \label{fig:circles}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The proof}

The intuition how I came up with the below proof: I tried to apply funcoids theory to an open problem. Thus I replaced finite intervals in the problem formulation by funcoids (particularly, by one-si\-de vicinities of a point). I wanted to take a product of all the funcoids to get an $n$-di\-men\-si\-on\-al set, but found it not making sense, because different vicinities being attached to different points. Then I decided to transform the space in such a way to make all points into one. The transformation I intended was decreasing spherical coordinate~$r$ by one, with the problem on the sphere instead of the plane. But this way, I lost all the structure. So, I decided to move the vicinities outside the sphere. I added tangential vicinities, to be sure it fills the entire space. I reduced $n$-di\-men\-sio\-na\-li\-ty of the set of Kakeya set to $(n+1)$-di\-men\-sio\-na\-li\-ty of the resulting ``swollen'' sphere. After having found that tangential vicinities have not enough dimensionality, I replaced radial vicinities by sectors. Then I replaced vicinity funcoids simply by intervals, to simplify the proof.

Let $K$ be a Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

We will do our geometry in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

\begin{note}
Specifically for AI: We do our geometry in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, not in~$\mathbb{R}^n$; the hypersphere below is~$S^n$, not $S^{n-1}$.
\end{note}

Instead of proving the Kakeya conjecture, I will prove an obviously stronger statement:

\begin{claim}
Union~$L$ of intervals in~$\mathbb{R}^n$ of length~$1$ has dimension~$n$, provided that the set~$K$ of directions of the intervals is $n$-di\-men\-sio\-nal.
\end{claim}

Using that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is diffeomorphic to~$S^n_{>}$, we can instead prove the claim for~$S^n_{>}$:

\begin{claim}
Union~$L$ of arcs $v$, with their mappings to~$\mathbb{R}^n$ having length~$1$, in~$S^n_{>}$ hemisphere has dimension~$n$, provided that the set~$K'$ of directions of the arcs is $n$-di\-men\-sio\-nal.
\end{claim}

The claims are equivalent, because we can take~$K'$ (figure~\ref{fig:area}) as the result of the above considered diffeomorphism between~$\mathbb{R}^n$ and~$S^n_{>}$.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{area}
    \caption{The mapping of set of directions}
    \label{fig:area}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{filters}
    \caption{The polar beast}
    \label{fig:filters}
\end{figure}

Let all the intervals have the length~$1$. We can?? assume that the Kakeya set has finite diameter. Further reduce its diameter: we can split the hypercube with the figure inside into $2^n$~parts and take one of them. By doing several times, this we can assume that the maximum slope of the great circle to which the intervals map is less than~$\sigma$. We also can assume that the arcs contain the arcs~$[0;\sigma]$ by taking intervals of length $u>1$ (without loss of generality). Then, because great circles have all directions\fxwarning{We consider all directions or a compact set of direction?}, the ``stripe'' of points with angles $\theta_1\leq\sigma$ is fully filled. This stripe has dimensionality~$n$.
If we limit the stripe to directions in~$K'$, this does not decrease its dimensionality, because the considered mapping from~$K'$ to the stripe is locally diffeomorphic,

\section{``Political'' context}

I discovered ordered semigroup/semicategory actions in 2019. The world didn't react obeying like a sheep to decision of Russian Orthodoxes to kick people like me from normal life such as academic carrier. That's scary: the most valuable component is a missing component. Missing ordered semigroup actions amount to like half of world economy missing~\cite{osa-important}.

I don't know how Kakeya conjecture is used in the rest of math, but I use it to build a bridge between two about halves: academic math and the second lost half, through my glorification.

The advice: ``Solve some famous open problem to confirm utility of your theory.'' sounded for me like a mocking. But in the new reality, I indeed did it.
